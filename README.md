# prework-study-guide

## A study guide for course pre-work.

The motivation for this project was to create a way to store notes about different coding languages all in place that is easy to access.
The project was built so I could learn different coding languages along the way whilst also creating something that would benefit myself.
Before this project was created because I had nowhere to store my notes on HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript. The creation of this project solved this.
I learnt many things along the way through the creation of this project, the most important thing being a lot more about HTML, CSS, Git & JavaScript.
